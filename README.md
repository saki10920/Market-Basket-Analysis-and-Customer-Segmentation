# Market Basket Analysis and Customer Segmentation

This project analyzes grocery transaction data to understand customer purchasing behavior.  
Using the **Groceries dataset**, we apply clustering, association rule mining, and optional supervised learning techniques to extract insights.  
The implementation is done using **WEKA Java API**.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to:
1. Segment customersinto groups using clustering techniques such as K-Means and EM.
2. Discover product associations** using the Apriori algorithm for Market Basket Analysis.
3. Predict customer basket type using supervised classifiers like J48, Random Forest, and SVM.
4. Save and reload trained models using WEKAâ€™s SerializationHelper
